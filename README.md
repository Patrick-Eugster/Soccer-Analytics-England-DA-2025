# Soccer Analytics Project

This repository is about the course project on soccer analytics using SkillCorner tracking data and Wyscout events. The goal was to explore different tactical aspects of match play by combining data analysis with visualizations.

My contribution was the section **“Match Tactics in Use,”** where I looked at defensive lines, compactness, and positional structures during different phases of the match.

A live demo of this part is available here:
